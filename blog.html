<article class="blog-roll"><h1 class="post-title">On Trust</h1><h2 class="date">January 27th, 2015</h2><p>As many of you know, I am a huge fan of Elena Brower&#8217;s meditation work and follow her course. She is an accomplished yoga teacher and is definitely having a moment within the yoga world, one that is heralding what I think is a change to how Americans approach their yoga practice. When I met her last spring before she closed Vira Yoga and I had the chance to talk with her about the practice, owning a yoga studio, and meditation, I just about died of happiness. Her focus is on creating balance (what a concept!) within your life through practice, meditation, honesty and habits. Her classes are mostly unconcerned with a peak pose or even working up a sweat most of the time. This was the first time in my life I didn&#8217;t groan at a really unapologetically simple practice. Truth. There was something really profound and practicing without ambition or the bells and whistles of crazy transitions or core work or handstands. It felt real. It felt advanced&#8230;like real work was happening.</p>
<p>My love affair with her work began early on in the studio&#8217;s life when one of our students lovingly gave me a book that Elena co-authored which has changed the way that I practice and, of course, the way that I teach. It was a change that I had been fumbling around for and was much needed at the time; being a driven and perfectionist personality had led to intense practice melt-down which constantly left me emotionally and physically drained and yet no more flexible mentally or in my body. I had been practicing in order to harden my body, become &#8220;better&#8221; and &#8220;more advanced&#8221; and yet was miles away from the true spirit of practicing yoga - to peel away the layers of assumed and given identity so that we may see ourselves more clearly.</p>
<p>This shift in perspective has led to more trust in my own abilities as a practitioner, romantic partner, owner, manager and teacher, and this opening to trust has opened doors to deeper love and respect for both myself and those lives with whom I am lucky to be in contact. I feel all of this when I practice earnestly and with reverence, and though there have definitely been growing pains, I know that this is the right path.</p>
<p>Trust, just like yoga or meditation, is a practice. When it comes to decisions, of which we make thousands and thousands of tiny decisions each day, we are in the habit of listening to that big ol&#8217; brain we have, but trust comes from the heart. You can practice trust within the context of your yoga practice by deeply tuning into what your heart and body crave each time you step on your mat. Even if you are drawn to practices that are a set sequence, such as Ashtanga or Bikram, a particular teacher or even rhythm of practice, learning to approach your yoga practice as new and without expectation each day is where you will find the true magic for your life experience. Stop being consumed by the outward appearance of progress. Trust that with greater intuition you are able to give your body, heart, and mind exactly what they need each day for greater, balanced health.</p>
<p>xo,</p>
